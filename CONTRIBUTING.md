# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Our roadmap](http://opengovernment.org/pages/wish-list) is the 10k foot view of where we're going, and
  * [TODO](#) is our day-to-day project management space.
  * Mailing list: Join our [developer list](#)
  * [Bugs](#)? Report them here

### Testing
We use [cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io) and its [Libraries and Tools]([cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/stubs-spies-and-clocks.html#Libraries-and-Tools)) for unit and e2e testing.

Please use cypress when writing tests.
Decide [what type of test](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/general-questions-faq.html#When-should-I-write-a-unit-test-and-when-should-I-write-an-end-to-end-test) you should write?


### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Atom. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/mlnck/.opensource/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Determine [which repository the problem should be reported in](https://github.com/mlnck?tab=repositories)**.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Amlnck)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](https://github.com/mlnck?tab=repositories)) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/mlnck/.opensource/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting a crash**, include the stack trace (which can be found from the online developer tools) in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, nclude the stack trace (which can be found from the online developer tools) in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Atom) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which browser (and version number of the browser) are you using?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running the browser in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Which packages do you have installed?** You can get that list by running `npm -ls`.
* **Are you using local configuration files**? If so, provide the contents of those files, preferably in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines) or with a link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/).
* **Are you using with multiple monitors?** If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?
* **Which keyboard layout are you using?** Are you using a US layout or some other layout?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Atom, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one.

Fill in [the template](https://github.com/mlnck/.opensource/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](https://github.com/mlnck?tab=repositories).**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Amlnck)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a new feature.
* **List some other applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which browser (and version number of the browser) you're using.**
